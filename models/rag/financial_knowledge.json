DBS/POSB Cardmembers (\"Cardmembers\") can now use an eligible DBS/POSB Card (\"Card\") with Apple Pay to pay at merchants who accept DBS contactless payments.  As a Cardmember, you can also get real-time notifications and details of your purchases when you use Apple Pay on iPhone or iPad. Notifications will be for your transactions made with Apple Pay or your Card.\r\nAll DBS/POSB Visa, American Express® & Mastercard® Credit and Debit Cards are eligible for Apple Pay. You may add up to a maximum of 8 Cards per device. Compatible devices include:\r\nList:\r\n- iPhone 6 and later for payments in stores, apps and websites in Safari\r\n- Apple Watch for payments in stores and apps (paired with your iPhone 6 or later)\r\n- iPad Pro, iPad (5th generation), iPad Air 2, and iPad mini 3 and later for payments in apps and websites in Safari\r\n- Mac (2012 or later) for payments in Safari with an Apple Pay-enabled iPhone or Apple Watch\r\niPhone 6 and later for payments in stores, apps and websites in Safari\r\nApple Watch for payments in stores and apps (paired with your iPhone 6 or later)\r\niPad Pro, iPad (5th generation), iPad Air 2, and iPad mini 3 and later for payments in apps and websites in Safari\r\nMac (2012 or later) for payments in Safari with an Apple Pay-enabled iPhone or Apple Watch\r\nApple Pay allows a maximum of 8 cards to be loaded to the Wallet.

The first Card you load will automatically become your default Card.\r\nYes, you can. Payment via Apple Pay will always be made with your default Card.

You will then receive a notification confirming your new default Card setting.\r\nNo, there is no need to open an app or wake your iPhone to make a payment. Simply place your iPhone near the contactless reader and complete the payment with Touch ID or Face ID. You will see \"Done\" on the display, along with a subtle vibration and beep, which lets you know your payment information has been sent. For Apple Watch, double-click the side button and hold the display of your Apple Watch up to the contactless reader. A gentle tap and beep will confirm that your payment information has been sent.\r\nYour Card in Apple Pay is protected by Touch ID, Face ID and/or your device Passcode. For your security, when you make a purchase using Apple Pay, you must either use Touch ID/Face ID or the Passcode for your device. All of your payment information will be encrypted in the Secure Element, a dedicated chip in your device.\r\nYes.

Find out more about DBS PayLah! here.\r\nLike all Google products, Google Pay comes with strong security protections at its core to continuously and automatically safeguard your account and personal data from security threats. And when you pay in stores, it shares a virtual account number instead of your real card details with the merchant. In other words, it's got your back so your real card details stay safe.\r\nIf your phone is ever lost or stolen, you can lock and erase it from anywhere with Find My Device.\nDBS PayLah! Related\nEach customer is entitled to only one DBS PayLah! account. Hence, only one DBS PayLah! account can be added to your Google Pay.\r\nPlease check to ensure that your PayLah! app is installed on the same device that you are using for Google Pay.\r\nEnjoy partnership deals exclusive to DBS PayLah! and Google Pay users. On top of that, you get to enjoy more deals as a DBS PayLah! user.\r\nPlease ensure that your transaction meets the minimum required amount set by every merchant.\r\nPlease check that you have not exceeded your PayLah! daily limit.\r\nHow to check PayLah! daily limit?\r\nContact the recipient directly to request for the return of funds.\r\nCheck your bank account linked to PayNow. The monies sent via Google Pay will be transferred to your bank account linked to PayNow.\nDBS/POSB Cards Related\nYou may add multiple eligible DBS/POSB Cards to your Google Pay on each device. To ensure that you are receiving the many benefits of DBS/POSB Cards, be sure to always select a DBS/POSB Card when paying with Google Pay.\r\nYes, you may add your eligible DBS/POSB Visa, American Express and Mastercard® Credit and Debit Card to multiple devices, but you will need to set your Card up on each device separately.\r\nWhen you use your DBS/POSB card with Google Pay, you'll continue to enjoy all the same rewards, benefits, and protection that come with it.

You can check and amend this limit via digibank. Daily transfer limit is capped at SGD200k.6PayNow is only available for participating banks in Singapore. See question 4 for the list of participating banks.\r\nYou can register for PayNow via digibank. During registration, you will be asked to (1) select the DBS/POSB account that you want to link to your selected PayNow Proxy (mobile number and/or NRIC/FIN number), and (2) set a PayNow Nickname for your registration.\r\nPlease note that you will need to register for PayNow first, before you can receive funds into your DBS/POSB bank account via PayNow.\r\nWhen a sender wishes to transfer funds to you via PayNow, he/she will enter your PayNow Proxy and perform a lookup. Doing so will display your PayNow Nickname, which in turn will allow the sender to verify that he/she is indeed transferring funds to the right person.\r\nPlease note that the Bank may limit the number of times a user can perform a Lookup within a time period. In addition, the Bank may, at its discretion, suspend or withdraw the PayNow service from any user found abusing the lookup feature.\r\nList:\r\n- ANEXT Bank\r\n- ANZ\r\n- BNP Paribas\r\n- BOC\r\n- CIMB\r\n- Citibank\r\n- DBS Bank/POSB\r\n- Deutsche Bank\r\n- GLDB\r\n- GXS\r\n- HSBC\r\n- ICBC\r\n- JP Morgan\r\n- MariBank\r\n- Maybank\r\n- OCBC\r\n- RHB\r\n- SMBC\r\n- Standard Chartered Bank\r\n- Trust\r\n- UOB\r\nANEXT Bank\r\nANZ\r\nBNP Paribas\r\nBOC\r\nCIMB\r\nCitibank\r\nDBS Bank/POSB\r\nDeutsche Bank\r\nGLDB\r\nGXS\r\nHSBC\r\nICBC\r\nJP Morgan\r\nMariBank\r\nMaybank\r\nOCBC\r\nRHB\r\nSMBC\r\nStandard Chartered Bank\r\nTrust\r\nUOB\r\nList:\r\n- Grab Financial Group\r\n- Liquid Group\r\n- Nium\r\n- Singtel Dash\r\n- Wise\r\n- Xfers\r\nGrab Financial Group\r\nLiquid Group\r\nNium\r\nSingtel Dash\r\nWise\r\nXfers\r\nAt present, PayNow is being operated by a third-party service provider appointed by the industry-wide scheme owner for PayNow.\r\nIn order to facilitate seamless lookups of PayNow proxies across participating banks, all PayNow related data will be stored in a central database operated by the third-party service provider.

NRIC or FIN number;b. A mobile number (local or foreign) that you have registered with DBS/POSB.\r\nPlease note that you can only register your bank-registered NRIC/FIN number and mobile number as PayNow Proxies, so please be sure to update your details with us.\r\nExisting customers can make a transfer to the following proxies belonging to their friend or merchant\r\nSimilar to mobile, NRIC/FIN and UEN, a VPA is a proxy that is used as an identifier, that can be uniquely mapped to an individual account. However, VPA is a proxy used only by Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NFIs), where users of participating NFIs can link to their e-wallets to receive funds via PayNow.\r\nA VPA will always have the following format:\r\nList:\r\n- Grab user:  +(Country Code)(mobile number)#GRAB [Consumer]UEN(UEN Number)#GRAB [Corporate]For example, +6591234567#GRABUEN1234567#GRAB\r\nGrab user:  +(Country Code)(mobile number)#GRAB [Consumer]UEN(UEN Number)#GRAB [Corporate]For example, +6591234567#GRABUEN1234567#GRAB\r\nList:\r\n- Liquid user: +(Country Code)(mobile number)#XNAP [Consumer]UEN(UEN Number)#XNAP [Corporate]For example, +6591234567#XNAPUEN1234567#XNAP\r\nLiquid user: +(Country Code)(mobile number)#XNAP [Consumer]UEN(UEN Number)#XNAP [Corporate]For example, +6591234567#XNAPUEN1234567#XNAP\r\nList:\r\n- Singtel Dash user: +(Country Code)(mobile number)#DASH [Consumer]UEN(UEN Number)#DASH [Corporate]For example, +6591234567#DASHUEN1234567#DASH\r\nSingtel Dash user: +(Country Code)(mobile number)#DASH [Consumer]UEN(UEN Number)#DASH [Corporate]For example, +6591234567#DASHUEN1234567#DASH\r\nNote that you will only be able to link your mobile number and NRIC/FIN number to your DBS or POSB current/savings account.\r\nYes, you may link both Proxies (NRIC/FIN and mobile number) to the same bank account.\r\nNo. If you have already linked your Proxy to a DBS/POSB bank account and wish to register the same Proxy with another bank, you will need to first de-register the Proxy from your DBS/POSB account (using the \"Delete\" option) via digibank before you can register it with another bank.\r\nYes, you can link one Proxy (such as your mobile number) to one bank account and a different Proxy (such as your NRIC/FIN) to another bank account. The two accounts can be from 2 different participating banks.\r\nIf you have already updated your FIN number with DBS/POSB, you can register your FIN as a PayNow Proxy via DBS digibank or digibank App.\r\nIf you are unable to see an option to register your FIN for PayNow, it might be because you have not updated your FIN with DBS. Learn to update your FIN on digibank mobile or SingPass here.\r\nOnce you receive your blue NRIC, please proceed to the nearest DBS/POSB branch to update your NRIC in the bank's records. During the update process, your FIN Proxy will be de-registered from PayNow and your NRIC will become eligible for registration.\r\nYou can subsequently register your NRIC as a PayNow Proxy, via DBS digibank or your digibank App.\r\nIf you have recently changed your mobile number, you should first update your new mobile number with the bank. You can do so via DBS digibank, or by visiting a DBS/POSB branch.\r\nOnce you have updated your mobile number with the bank, your old mobile number will automatically be de-registered from PayNow. An SMS notification will be sent to the old mobile number, to confirm the de-registration.\r\nYou can then register your new mobile number as a PayNow Proxy via digibank.\r\nThis might be because you have already registered that mobile number as a PayNow Proxy with another bank, in which case you will first need to de-register your Proxy from the other bank. Please note that you cannot register the same mobile number as a PayNow Proxy with 2 different banks.\r\nHowever, if you have never registered your mobile number as a PayNow Proxy with another bank, such a scenario might arise if you are using a recycled mobile number that used to belong to someone else. You can call our hotline or visit your nearest DBS/POSB branch to report this issue, and our bank officers will assist you accordingly. Please note that such issues may take up to 9 working days to be resolved.\r\nPlease note that only bank-registered mobile numbers can be registered as PayNow Proxies i.e. you will not be able to type in any mobile number you want to register. Your PayNow Proxy mobile number will be extracted from the bank's internal database, based on the mobile registered with the bank. It is therefore important that you provide us with your updated contact particulars, including your email address, so that we can reach you to resolve any matters related to PayNow.\r\nAs an additional control, when a mobile number is being registered as a PayNow Proxy, an SMS-OTP will be sent to that mobile number to verify that the registrant is indeed the rightful owner of the mobile number.\r\nYes, you may log in to your digibank mobile or digibank online to check. Find out more on how to check on your PayNow profile here.\r\nWhen you link a PayNow Proxy to your bank account, you will be asked to enter a PayNow nickname as well. You are encouraged to choose a nickname that can help others identify who you are. This is because when a sender wishes to transfer money to you via PayNow, he/she will enter your PayNow Proxy and perform a lookup. The lookup will return your Nickname, and will allow the sender to verify that he/she is indeed transferring money to the right person.To protect your privacy, please do not use a personal identifier which can be found in your NRIC / Passport as your nickname.\r\nYes, you may change your PayNow Nickname using the Edit option on the digibank App.\r\nAll single, joint-alternate and joint-all DBS/POSB Current and Savings accounts are eligible to be linked to PayNow Proxies. However, please note that joint-all accounts can only receive funds and cannot be used to send funds.\r\nYes, each joint account holder can choose to link his/her own PayNow Proxies to the same joint account.\r\nOnce you close your bank account, all PayNow proxies linked to that account will automatically be de-registered, and you will be notified accordingly via SMS.\r\nYes, you may change the bank account linked to your PayNow proxies using the Edit option on the digibank App.\r\nThe maximum limit for PayNow transfers is the same as of your daily local interbank transfer limit. You can manage this limit online via DBS digibank.\r\nThe maximum transaction amount for PayNow is S$200k per transaction, which follows the industry limit and cannot be adjusted.\r\nPayNow transfers up to a cumulative daily limit of S$1,000 can be performed without requiring your digibank token.\r\nFor PayNow transfers above S$1,000, you will need to perform transaction signing (using your digibank token).\r\nThe transfer limit for a PayNow QR is the same as a normal PayNow transfer.\r\nPrior to performing a PayNow transfer, you should check whether the PayNow Proxy you are sending funds to belongs to your intended payee.\r\nDuring the PayNow transfer process, once you enter the PayNow Proxy that you wish to pay, a lookup will be performed and the PayNow Nickname associated with the Proxy will be displayed. You should check whether the displayed Nickname belongs to the person to whom you are transferring funds.\r\nYou should call our DBS/POSB hotline immediately to report the erroneous transfer and to follow our usual procedures for such mistaken transfers. In addition, you should lodge a police report, and be responsive to police investigations.\r\nThe bank will try its best to recover the funds on your behalf. However, do note that the bank does not guarantee successful recovery of such funds and you are encouraged to be prudent to check the Nickname and Proxy details before submitting the transfer.\r\nYou should call our DBS/POSB hotline immediately to report the erroneous transfer and we will take the necessary steps to reverse such transaction.\r\nPlease note that if we are informed by the sender of the funds (or an authorised representative) that a transfer was made to you erroneously, the Bank has the right to and may reverse such transaction pursuant to our Standard Terms and Conditions Governing Accounts without further reference to you. If you wish to dispute the error alleged by the sender, you may approach the sender of the funds directly.\r\nWe wish to highlight that it is a criminal offence to hold or use funds that do not belong to you.\r\nPayNow transactions appearing on your bank statement will include the term \"PayNow Transfer\" together with the name of your payee. These transactions will NOT include details of your payee's bank or bank account number. Do note, however, that PayNow transfers between two DBS accounts will be formatted differently in your bank statement, as compared to PayNow transfers between a DBS and a non-DBS account.\r\nPayNow transactions on your payee's bank statement will NOT include your bank details (i.e. bank's name and account number). The specific transaction format will be determined by your payee's bank.\r\nFor PayNow transfers made by you, your recipient will be able to see your full name according to your registered record with the bank. We are required to share this information with the receiving bank in line with the prevention of money laundering. The receiving bank may in turn display your full name to enable the recipient to identify the sender.\r\nFor PayNow transfers received by you, your sender will only be able to see your PayNow nickname as chosen by you.\r\nYou will receive an SMS notification for outgoing PayNow transfers, and an email notification for incoming PayNow transfers, unless you have opted to receive notification via another mode, for example, through a push note.\r\nPaynow QR is an easier way for consumers to pay corporates and other consumers. By using the Scan and Pay function in digibank Mobile / PayLah!, consumers can scan a PayNow QR to initiate a PayNow transfer to the mobile number/UEN of the recipient consumer/corporate respectively.\r\nMy QR is the QR Code created for your PayNow Mobile proxy. It is available to you once you register your mobile number with PayNow via DBS/POSB digibank. You can share this QR code to receive funds easily via your PayNow registered mobile number.\r\nGenerate QR is a PayNow QR which you can generate for various specified purposes.

By registering for PayNow, you agree to the Terms and Conditions Governing Accounts and Terms and Conditions Governing Electronic Services, which apply to both the PayNow service and the PayNow-UPI service.\r\nOpting out of receiving funds from India via PayNow-UPI:PayNow users will be automatically opted into the PayNow-UPI service.

A digiVault Account is a separate locked account that auto-locks all the funds you deposit. While locking savings in an existing account means you can choose any amount inside that account to lock. The first way separates your spending with a dedicated savings account. While the latter allows you to keep spending from your existing account, depending on how much you lock.\r\nBoth ways give your savings extra protection, so it's up to you.\r\nYes, you can first unlock your digiVault Account and transfer funds to any existing accounts and lock it instantly on the digibank app. Simply tap the \"lock with digiVault\" icon in the account you'd like to lock savings.\r\nYes, you can lock funds in your Joint-Alternate Current and/or Savings Account.\r\nJoint-ALL account funds are not eligible for locking, as they are already protected against digital transactions.\r\nTo unlock funds for Joint-Alternate Accounts, any ONE account holder can unlock instantly at any DBS/POSB ATM, Branch Teller Machine (BTM) or Video Teller Machine (VTM).\r\nYes, you can still lock funds in such an account.

You can check and amend this limit via digibank. Daily transfer limit is capped at SGD200k.6PayNow is only available for participating banks in Singapore. See question 4 for the list of participating banks.\r\nYou can register for PayNow via digibank. During registration, you will be asked to (1) select the DBS/POSB account that you want to link to your selected PayNow Proxy (mobile number and/or NRIC/FIN number), and (2) set a PayNow Nickname for your registration.\r\nPlease note that you will need to register for PayNow first, before you can receive funds into your DBS/POSB bank account via PayNow.\r\nWhen a sender wishes to transfer funds to you via PayNow, he/she will enter your PayNow Proxy and perform a lookup. Doing so will display your PayNow Nickname, which in turn will allow the sender to verify that he/she is indeed transferring funds to the right person.\r\nPlease note that the Bank may limit the number of times a user can perform a Lookup within a time period. In addition, the Bank may, at its discretion, suspend or withdraw the PayNow service from any user found abusing the lookup feature.\r\nList:\r\n- ANEXT Bank\r\n- ANZ\r\n- BNP Paribas\r\n- BOC\r\n- CIMB\r\n- Citibank\r\n- DBS Bank/POSB\r\n- Deutsche Bank\r\n- GLDB\r\n- GXS\r\n- HSBC\r\n- ICBC\r\n- JP Morgan\r\n- MariBank\r\n- Maybank\r\n- OCBC\r\n- RHB\r\n- SMBC\r\n- Standard Chartered Bank\r\n- Trust\r\n- UOB\r\nANEXT Bank\r\nANZ\r\nBNP Paribas\r\nBOC\r\nCIMB\r\nCitibank\r\nDBS Bank/POSB\r\nDeutsche Bank\r\nGLDB\r\nGXS\r\nHSBC\r\nICBC\r\nJP Morgan\r\nMariBank\r\nMaybank\r\nOCBC\r\nRHB\r\nSMBC\r\nStandard Chartered Bank\r\nTrust\r\nUOB\r\nList:\r\n- Grab Financial Group\r\n- Liquid Group\r\n- Nium\r\n- Singtel Dash\r\n- Wise\r\n- Xfers\r\nGrab Financial Group\r\nLiquid Group\r\nNium\r\nSingtel Dash\r\nWise\r\nXfers\r\nAt present, PayNow is being operated by a third-party service provider appointed by the industry-wide scheme owner for PayNow.\r\nIn order to facilitate seamless lookups of PayNow proxies across participating banks, all PayNow related data will be stored in a central database operated by the third-party service provider.

NRIC or FIN number;b. A mobile number (local or foreign) that you have registered with DBS/POSB.\r\nPlease note that you can only register your bank-registered NRIC/FIN number and mobile number as PayNow Proxies, so please be sure to update your details with us.\r\nExisting customers can make a transfer to the following proxies belonging to their friend or merchant\r\nSimilar to mobile, NRIC/FIN and UEN, a VPA is a proxy that is used as an identifier, that can be uniquely mapped to an individual account. However, VPA is a proxy used only by Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NFIs), where users of participating NFIs can link to their e-wallets to receive funds via PayNow.\r\nA VPA will always have the following format:\r\nList:\r\n- Grab user:  +(Country Code)(mobile number)#GRAB [Consumer]UEN(UEN Number)#GRAB [Corporate]For example, +6591234567#GRABUEN1234567#GRAB\r\nGrab user:  +(Country Code)(mobile number)#GRAB [Consumer]UEN(UEN Number)#GRAB [Corporate]For example, +6591234567#GRABUEN1234567#GRAB\r\nList:\r\n- Liquid user: +(Country Code)(mobile number)#XNAP [Consumer]UEN(UEN Number)#XNAP [Corporate]For example, +6591234567#XNAPUEN1234567#XNAP\r\nLiquid user: +(Country Code)(mobile number)#XNAP [Consumer]UEN(UEN Number)#XNAP [Corporate]For example, +6591234567#XNAPUEN1234567#XNAP\r\nList:\r\n- Singtel Dash user: +(Country Code)(mobile number)#DASH [Consumer]UEN(UEN Number)#DASH [Corporate]For example, +6591234567#DASHUEN1234567#DASH\r\nSingtel Dash user: +(Country Code)(mobile number)#DASH [Consumer]UEN(UEN Number)#DASH [Corporate]For example, +6591234567#DASHUEN1234567#DASH\r\nNote that you will only be able to link your mobile number and NRIC/FIN number to your DBS or POSB current/savings account.\r\nYes, you may link both Proxies (NRIC/FIN and mobile number) to the same bank account.\r\nNo. If you have already linked your Proxy to a DBS/POSB bank account and wish to register the same Proxy with another bank, you will need to first de-register the Proxy from your DBS/POSB account (using the \"Delete\" option) via digibank before you can register it with another bank.\r\nYes, you can link one Proxy (such as your mobile number) to one bank account and a different Proxy (such as your NRIC/FIN) to another bank account. The two accounts can be from 2 different participating banks.\r\nIf you have already updated your FIN number with DBS/POSB, you can register your FIN as a PayNow Proxy via DBS digibank or digibank App.\r\nIf you are unable to see an option to register your FIN for PayNow, it might be because you have not updated your FIN with DBS. Learn to update your FIN on digibank mobile or SingPass here.\r\nOnce you receive your blue NRIC, please proceed to the nearest DBS/POSB branch to update your NRIC in the bank's records. During the update process, your FIN Proxy will be de-registered from PayNow and your NRIC will become eligible for registration.\r\nYou can subsequently register your NRIC as a PayNow Proxy, via DBS digibank or your digibank App.\r\nIf you have recently changed your mobile number, you should first update your new mobile number with the bank. You can do so via DBS digibank, or by visiting a DBS/POSB branch.\r\nOnce you have updated your mobile number with the bank, your old mobile number will automatically be de-registered from PayNow. An SMS notification will be sent to the old mobile number, to confirm the de-registration.\r\nYou can then register your new mobile number as a PayNow Proxy via digibank.\r\nThis might be because you have already registered that mobile number as a PayNow Proxy with another bank, in which case you will first need to de-register your Proxy from the other bank. Please note that you cannot register the same mobile number as a PayNow Proxy with 2 different banks.\r\nHowever, if you have never registered your mobile number as a PayNow Proxy with another bank, such a scenario might arise if you are using a recycled mobile number that used to belong to someone else. You can call our hotline or visit your nearest DBS/POSB branch to report this issue, and our bank officers will assist you accordingly. Please note that such issues may take up to 9 working days to be resolved.\r\nPlease note that only bank-registered mobile numbers can be registered as PayNow Proxies i.e. you will not be able to type in any mobile number you want to register. Your PayNow Proxy mobile number will be extracted from the bank's internal database, based on the mobile registered with the bank. It is therefore important that you provide us with your updated contact particulars, including your email address, so that we can reach you to resolve any matters related to PayNow.\r\nAs an additional control, when a mobile number is being registered as a PayNow Proxy, an SMS-OTP will be sent to that mobile number to verify that the registrant is indeed the rightful owner of the mobile number.\r\nYes, you may log in to your digibank mobile or digibank online to check. Find out more on how to check on your PayNow profile here.\r\nWhen you link a PayNow Proxy to your bank account, you will be asked to enter a PayNow nickname as well. You are encouraged to choose a nickname that can help others identify who you are. This is because when a sender wishes to transfer money to you via PayNow, he/she will enter your PayNow Proxy and perform a lookup. The lookup will return your Nickname, and will allow the sender to verify that he/she is indeed transferring money to the right person.To protect your privacy, please do not use a personal identifier which can be found in your NRIC / Passport as your nickname.\r\nYes, you may change your PayNow Nickname using the Edit option on the digibank App.\r\nAll single, joint-alternate and joint-all DBS/POSB Current and Savings accounts are eligible to be linked to PayNow Proxies. However, please note that joint-all accounts can only receive funds and cannot be used to send funds.\r\nYes, each joint account holder can choose to link his/her own PayNow Proxies to the same joint account.\r\nOnce you close your bank account, all PayNow proxies linked to that account will automatically be de-registered, and you will be notified accordingly via SMS.\r\nYes, you may change the bank account linked to your PayNow proxies using the Edit option on the digibank App.\r\nThe maximum limit for PayNow transfers is the same as of your daily local interbank transfer limit. You can manage this limit online via DBS digibank.\r\nThe maximum transaction amount for PayNow is S$200k per transaction, which follows the industry limit and cannot be adjusted.\r\nPayNow transfers up to a cumulative daily limit of S$1,000 can be performed without requiring your digibank token.\r\nFor PayNow transfers above S$1,000, you will need to perform transaction signing (using your digibank token).\r\nThe transfer limit for a PayNow QR is the same as a normal PayNow transfer.\r\nPrior to performing a PayNow transfer, you should check whether the PayNow Proxy you are sending funds to belongs to your intended payee.\r\nDuring the PayNow transfer process, once you enter the PayNow Proxy that you wish to pay, a lookup will be performed and the PayNow Nickname associated with the Proxy will be displayed. You should check whether the displayed Nickname belongs to the person to whom you are transferring funds.\r\nYou should call our DBS/POSB hotline immediately to report the erroneous transfer and to follow our usual procedures for such mistaken transfers. In addition, you should lodge a police report, and be responsive to police investigations.\r\nThe bank will try its best to recover the funds on your behalf. However, do note that the bank does not guarantee successful recovery of such funds and you are encouraged to be prudent to check the Nickname and Proxy details before submitting the transfer.\r\nYou should call our DBS/POSB hotline immediately to report the erroneous transfer and we will take the necessary steps to reverse such transaction.\r\nPlease note that if we are informed by the sender of the funds (or an authorised representative) that a transfer was made to you erroneously, the Bank has the right to and may reverse such transaction pursuant to our Standard Terms and Conditions Governing Accounts without further reference to you. If you wish to dispute the error alleged by the sender, you may approach the sender of the funds directly.\r\nWe wish to highlight that it is a criminal offence to hold or use funds that do not belong to you.\r\nPayNow transactions appearing on your bank statement will include the term \"PayNow Transfer\" together with the name of your payee. These transactions will NOT include details of your payee's bank or bank account number. Do note, however, that PayNow transfers between two DBS accounts will be formatted differently in your bank statement, as compared to PayNow transfers between a DBS and a non-DBS account.\r\nPayNow transactions on your payee's bank statement will NOT include your bank details (i.e. bank's name and account number). The specific transaction format will be determined by your payee's bank.\r\nFor PayNow transfers made by you, your recipient will be able to see your full name according to your registered record with the bank. We are required to share this information with the receiving bank in line with the prevention of money laundering. The receiving bank may in turn display your full name to enable the recipient to identify the sender.\r\nFor PayNow transfers received by you, your sender will only be able to see your PayNow nickname as chosen by you.\r\nYou will receive an SMS notification for outgoing PayNow transfers, and an email notification for incoming PayNow transfers, unless you have opted to receive notification via another mode, for example, through a push note.\r\nPaynow QR is an easier way for consumers to pay corporates and other consumers. By using the Scan and Pay function in digibank Mobile / PayLah!, consumers can scan a PayNow QR to initiate a PayNow transfer to the mobile number/UEN of the recipient consumer/corporate respectively.\r\nMy QR is the QR Code created for your PayNow Mobile proxy. It is available to you once you register your mobile number with PayNow via DBS/POSB digibank.

Starting from August 2020, DBS PayLah! users can transact digitally via the scanning of SGQR codes at FavePay partners.\r\nFave has 3 types of cashback:\r\nFave Cashback: Fave Cashback is earned via a promo code and usable across all product functions - FavePay, Fave Deals and eCards. Valid for 30 days.\r\nFave e-Cashback: These are valid for 3 months from the date of issuance to offset your future transactions on Fave app, such as Fave deals, or eCards.\r\nFave Partner Cashback: This cashback is earned via a FavePay transaction and usable at the same merchant. It is the return of a percentage of your total bill (not including any amount paid with promo codes and cashback) in the form of partner cashback. For example, the restaurant offers a 15% cashback. Your total bill at XYZ Restaurant is S$10 and you pay S$2 in cashback, while S$8 is paid for in cash.\r\nAfter a successful FavePay transaction, you will receive S$1.20 (15% of cash amount paid) in partner cashback that can be used during your next visit at XYZ Restaurant. This cashback will be added to your partner cashback. You can use the cashback for your next FavePay transaction with the same partner as they are valid for 2-3 months. The validity of the cashback is indicated in your Fave account.\r\nFave Deals and eCards are pre-purchased vouchers that can be used at Fave's participating partners. These vouchers can be bought via the Fave app with Fave credits.\r\nTable:\r\n\tNot on PayLah! yet?

This works out to a total of up to S$1,920 in cashback every year.\nFaqs\nThe cashback earned on the transactions performed in the current month will be credited in the OCBC 365 card statement in the next month.\nFaqs\nTransaction date refers to the date when a purchase is made.\nFaqs\nPosting date refers to the date the transaction is received by the card issuer, OCBC Bank. As merchants may make a settlement a few days after the transaction has been made, posting date may be a few days later than the transaction date. As such, the bank has no control over when merchant records the transaction.\nFaqs\nThe cashback computation is based on the transactions posted within the calendar month.\nFaqs\nThe MCC is a four digit-number assigned by Visa/Mastercard to describe the main business activity of a merchant. It is determined by the merchant's acquiring bank (a financial institution that accepts and processes credit and debit card transactions on behalf of merchants).\nFaqs\nAs the card issuer, OCBC does not determine the main business activity of a merchant or the MCC assigned.\nFaqs\nWe use MCCs to decide whether certain transactions qualify for cashback. For example, OCBC 365 Cardmembers earn cashback only on transactions that fall under certain MCCs (e.g. MCC 5812 - Eating places and Restaurant).\nFaqs\nIf the merchant's acquiring bank assigns it an incorrect MCC, we will not be able to reward you for transactions made there. For example, if a merchant was determined to be a 'Bar' instead of a 'Restaurant', an OCBC 365 Cardmember will not be able to earn cashback on transactions made there - since transactions under 'MCC 5813 - Bars, Taverns, Lounges, Disco' do not qualify for cashback."

A merchant's registered MCC may not always correspond with its nature of business.\nFaqs\nThere is no limit to the base OCBC$ you can earn. You can earn up to 120,000 bonus OCBC$ a year, and up to 10,000 bonus OCBC$ a month.\nFaqs\nBonus OCBC$ can be earned through transactions made by the principal and supplementary card holder(s). Then, the OCBC$ will be credited to the primary card holder's OCBC$ account.\nFaqs\nOnce the limit of 10,000 bonus OCBC$ is reached for the month, you will earn the base OCBC$ (i.e. 1 OCBC$ for every S$1 spent) for your transactions.\nFaqs\nThe base OCBC$ of 1 OCBC$ for every S$1 spent will be credited to your account when the transaction is posted.\nFaqs\nIf the transaction qualifies for bonus OCBC$, the remaining 9 OCBC$ for every S$1 spent will be credited by the last day of the next month.\nFaqs\nFor example, if a S$500 Lazada purchase is made on:\nFaqs\n15 November 2023 (transaction date) and posted on 17 November 2023 (posted date), 500 OCBC$ will be credited to your account on 15 November 2023 and the remaining 4,500 OCBC$ on 31 December 2023.\nFaqs\n28 November 2023 (transaction date) and posted on 2 December 2023 (posted date), 500 OCBC$ will be credited to your account on 28 November 2023 and the remaining 4,500 OCBC$ on 31 January 2024.\nFaqs\nThe MCC is a four digit-number assigned by Visa/Mastercard to describe the main business activity of a merchant. It is determined by the merchant's acquiring bank (a financial institution that accepts and processes credit and debit card transactions on behalf of merchants).\nFaqs\nAs the card issuer, OCBC does not determine the main business activity of a merchant or the MCC assigned.\nFaqs\nWe use MCCs to decide whether certain transactions qualify for OCBC$. For example, OCBC Rewards Cardmembers earn bonus OCBC$ only on transactions that fall under certain MCCs (e.g. MCC 5261 - Women's Ready to Wear Stores).\nFaqs\nIf the merchant's acquiring bank assigns it an incorrect MCC, we will not be able to reward you for transactions made there. For example, if a merchant was determined to be a 'Tailor' instead of a 'Women's Ready to Wear Store', an OCBC Rewards Cardmember will not be able to earn bonus OCBC$ on transactions made there - since transactions under 'MCC 5697 - Alterations, Mending, Seamstresses, Tailors' do not qualify for bonus OCBC$."
