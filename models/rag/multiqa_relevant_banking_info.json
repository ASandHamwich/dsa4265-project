The Guidelines do not apply to transactions which you initiated because of a scam or fraud. Such transactions will be investigated by the police.\nHow can I report an unauthorized transaction?\nPlease call our 24-hour DBS Customer Service Hotline at 1800 339 6963 or +65 6339 6963 (Overseas) immediately for assistance. Our customer service officer will ask you to provide more details about yourself, your protected account and the transaction in order for us to commence investigations and update you.\nHow can I report an erroneous transaction?\nPlease call our 24-hour DBS Customer Service Hotline at 1800 111 1111 or +65 6327 2265 (Overseas) immediately for assistance. Our customer service officer will ask you to provide more details about yourself, your protected account and the transaction in order for us to commence investigations and update you.\nWhat happens after I report an unauthorised transaction?\nAfter receiving the information required to facilitate the investigation, we will complete an investigation of any relevant claim within 21 business days for straightforward cases or 45 business days for complex cases.\r\nComplex cases may include cases where any party to the unauthorised transaction is residing overseas or where the Bank has insufficient information from you to complete the investigation. We will update you of the outcome of our investigation. If it has been assessed that you are not liable for any loss from the unauthorised transaction, we will credit your account as soon as our assessment is complete.\r\nFor erroneous or unauthorised transactions on credit cards, charge cards or debit cards, the dispute resolution process established under the respective card scheme will apply.\nWhat happens after I report an erroneous transaction?\nWe will endeavour to assist to recall the funds from the recipient and update you of the outcome. Longer time may be taken for more complex cases.\nWhat are my liabilities for losses arising from unauthorised transactions?\nYou will not be liable for any loss that arises from any action or omission by us, if you have complied with your duties as an account holder. For losses due to any other independent third party other than you and us, subject to the below, you will also not be liable if the outgoing transaction value is within S$1,000.\r\nYou will, however, be liable if it is ascertained that the primary cause was recklessness on your part, such as failing to protect your access code, login credentials or access to your protected account. Your liability will be capped at the transaction limit or daily payment limit, where applicable.\r\nIn all cases, we will conduct an assessment to determine the appropriate liabilities and work towards a fair and reasonable resolution.\r\nFor transactions on credit cards, charge cards and debit cards issued in Singapore, the apportioning of liabilities is governed by the ABS Code of Consumer Banking Practice.\nWhat is a protected account?\nProtected accounts are those that:\nWhat type of transactions are covered by the Guidelines?\nThe Guidelines cover all payments from protected accounts initiated through electronic means, and where funds are received through electronic means.\r\nThe Guidelines do not apply to transactions which you initiated because of a scam or fraud.\nWhat are my duties as an account holder or account user?\nThe Guidelines set out your duties as an e-payment user to adopt good security practices. These include:\nWhat are transaction notifications for?\nThey safeguard you against unauthorised and erroneous transactions. They are to alert you of such transactions so that you may report them to us for quicker resolution.\nWhat are the types of transaction notifications offered by DBS and how can I enrol for these notifications?\nPlease refer to our Transaction Alerts page.\r\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore has issued the E-Payments User Protection Guidelines (\"Guidelines\") to protect users of electronic payments and encourage wider adoption of e-payments in Singapore. The Guidelines establishes a common baseline protection that financial institutions will provide to individuals or sole proprietors from losses arising from isolated unauthorised or erroneous epayment transactions from their protected accounts. Here are some common questions about the Guidelines.\r\nFor more information on MAS' Guidelines, you may refer to the FAQ on E-Payments User Protection Guidelines by ABS.",

This works out to a total of up to S$1,920 in cashback every year.\nFaqs\nThe cashback earned on the transactions performed in the current month will be credited in the OCBC 365 card statement in the next month.\nFaqs\nTransaction date refers to the date when a purchase is made.\nFaqs\nPosting date refers to the date the transaction is received by the card issuer, OCBC Bank. As merchants may make a settlement a few days after the transaction has been made, posting date may be a few days later than the transaction date. As such, the bank has no control over when merchant records the transaction.\nFaqs\nThe cashback computation is based on the transactions posted within the calendar month.\nFaqs\nThe MCC is a four digit-number assigned by Visa/Mastercard to describe the main business activity of a merchant. It is determined by the merchant's acquiring bank (a financial institution that accepts and processes credit and debit card transactions on behalf of merchants).\nFaqs\nAs the card issuer, OCBC does not determine the main business activity of a merchant or the MCC assigned.\nFaqs\nWe use MCCs to decide whether certain transactions qualify for cashback. For example, OCBC 365 Cardmembers earn cashback only on transactions that fall under certain MCCs (e.g. MCC 5812 - Eating places and Restaurant).\nFaqs\nIf the merchant's acquiring bank assigns it an incorrect MCC, we will not be able to reward you for transactions made there. For example, if a merchant was determined to be a 'Bar' instead of a 'Restaurant', an OCBC 365 Cardmember will not be able to earn cashback on transactions made there - since transactions under 'MCC 5813 - Bars, Taverns, Lounges, Disco' do not qualify for cashback.",
