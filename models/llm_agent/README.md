FinTailorAI is a command-line financial advisor that uses OpenAIâ€™s GPT models and Singapore banking data to provide personalized financial advice. It supports loading user financial and transaction data from JSON files and uses built-in or custom banking product data to recommend relevant financial solutions. 

To use, install Python 3.8+, run pip install openai python-dotenv, and set your OpenAI API key in a .env file. Start the advisor with python main.py and optionally provide paths to financial, transaction, or banking JSON files. You can also call generate_financial_advice() in your own Python scripts for integration. Use commands like help, status, and exit in interactive mode. 

The project retrieves default data from relative paths: ../bert/sample_output/insights.json for financial data, ../bert/sample_output/transactions.json for transaction history, and ../rag/multiqa_relevant_banking_info.json for banking RAG data.
