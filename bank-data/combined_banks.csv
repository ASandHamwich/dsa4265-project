To find out the current daily spend/NETS/withdrawal limits on your debit card and to revise these limits, you may do so on digibank. Find out more on how to update ATM/Debit Card Limits.
The total amount of cash that you can withdraw per day at both local and overseas ATMs is capped. This daily cash withdrawal limit applies regardless of the number of cards you have.
If you prefer to only use your Visa, MasterCard or UnionPay Debit card(s) for PIN-based NETS and ATM transactions and would like to disable the contactless feature, you may do so on digibank. Find out more on how to customise your Card Functions.
Disabling the contactless feature will not affect your NETS and ATM transactions.
You can change your Card's primary account linkage to other Savings or Current Account. Find out more here.

GIRO reduces the hassle of performing ad-hoc payments for your bills as they will be automatically deducted from your designated DBS/POSB account and paid to your respective BO upon their request. All you need to do is to ensure that this account has sufficient funds before the deduction due date.
Pro tip: Check with your BO on your deduction due date.
To avoid unsuccessful GIRO deductions due to insufficient funds, we advise you to check that your account has the required amount a day before the deduction date.
For example:Your BO makes the deduction regularly on the 10th of every month. Ensure that your bank account has sufficient funds by latest 11:59 pm on the 9th.

PayNow is an electronic fund transfer service that allows you to transfer SGD funds5 instantly to a payee, using the payee's designated mobile number or NRIC/FIN or UEN number instead of his/her bank account number.
A payee can receive funds via PayNow as long as he/she has a Singapore bank account with one of the PayNow participating banks6, and has registered his mobile number, UEN or NRIC/FIN as a PayNow Proxy with the participating bank.
5You can transfer SGD funds via PayNow up to your maximum daily local interbank transfer limit. You can check and amend this limit via digibank. Daily transfer limit is capped at SGD200k.6PayNow is only available for participating banks in Singapore. See question 4 for the list of participating banks.
You can register for PayNow via digibank. During registration, you will be asked to (1) select the DBS/POSB account that you want to link to your selected PayNow Proxy (mobile number and/or NRIC/FIN number), and (2) set a PayNow Nickname for your registration.
Please note that you will need to register for PayNow first, before you can receive funds into your DBS/POSB bank account via PayNow.
When a sender wishes to transfer funds to you via PayNow, he/she will enter your PayNow Proxy and perform a lookup. Doing so will display your PayNow Nickname, which in turn will allow the sender to verify that he/she is indeed transferring funds to the right person.
Please note that the Bank may limit the number of times a user can perform a Lookup within a time period. In addition, the Bank may, at its discretion, suspend or withdraw the PayNow service from any user found abusing the lookup feature.

A PayNow Proxy is a personal identifier that you can link to your bank account.
Existing customers with DBS or POSB current/savings accounts can link the following proxies to their bank account:a. NRIC or FIN number;b. A mobile number (local or foreign) that you have registered with DBS/POSB.
Please note that you can only register your bank-registered NRIC/FIN number and mobile number as PayNow Proxies, so please be sure to update your details with us.
Existing customers can make a transfer to the following proxies belonging to their friend or merchant
Similar to mobile, NRIC/FIN and UEN, a VPA is a proxy that is used as an identifier, that can be uniquely mapped to an individual account. However, VPA is a proxy used only by Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NFIs), where users of participating NFIs can link to their e-wallets to receive funds via PayNow.
A VPA will always have the following format:

Note that you will only be able to link your mobile number and NRIC/FIN number to your DBS or POSB current/savings account.
Yes, you may link both Proxies (NRIC/FIN and mobile number) to the same bank account.
No. If you have already linked your Proxy to a DBS/POSB bank account and wish to register the same Proxy with another bank, you will need to first de-register the Proxy from your DBS/POSB account (using the ""Delete"" option) via digibank before you can register it with another bank.
Yes, you can link one Proxy (such as your mobile number) to one bank account and a different Proxy (such as your NRIC/FIN) to another bank account. The two accounts can be from 2 different participating banks.
If you have already updated your FIN number with DBS/POSB, you can register your FIN as a PayNow Proxy via DBS digibank or digibank App.
If you are unable to see an option to register your FIN for PayNow, it might be because you have not updated your FIN with DBS. Learn to update your FIN on digibank mobile or SingPass here.
Once you receive your blue NRIC, please proceed to the nearest DBS/POSB branch to update your NRIC in the bank's records. During the update process, your FIN Proxy will be de-registered from PayNow and your NRIC will become eligible for registration.
You can subsequently register your NRIC as a PayNow Proxy, via DBS digibank or your digibank App.
If you have recently changed your mobile number, you should first update your new mobile number with the bank. You can do so via DBS digibank, or by visiting a DBS/POSB branch.
Once you have updated your mobile number with the bank, your old mobile number will automatically be de-registered from PayNow. An SMS notification will be sent to the old mobile number, to confirm the de-registration.
You can then register your new mobile number as a PayNow Proxy via digibank.
This might be because you have already registered that mobile number as a PayNow Proxy with another bank, in which case you will first need to de-register your Proxy from the other bank. Please note that you cannot register the same mobile number as a PayNow Proxy with 2 different banks.
However, if you have never registered your mobile number as a PayNow Proxy with another bank, such a scenario might arise if you are using a recycled mobile number that used to belong to someone else. You can call our hotline or visit your nearest DBS/POSB branch to report this issue, and our bank officers will assist you accordingly. Please note that such issues may take up to 9 working days to be resolved.
Please note that only bank-registered mobile numbers can be registered as PayNow Proxies i.e. you will not be able to type in any mobile number you want to register. Your PayNow Proxy mobile number will be extracted from the bank's internal database, based on the mobile registered with the bank. It is therefore important that you provide us with your updated contact particulars, including your email address, so that we can reach you to resolve any matters related to PayNow.
As an additional control, when a mobile number is being registered as a PayNow Proxy, an SMS-OTP will be sent to that mobile number to verify that the registrant is indeed the rightful owner of the mobile number.
Yes, you may log in to your digibank mobile or digibank online to check. Find out more on how to check on your PayNow profile here.
When you link a PayNow Proxy to your bank account, you will be asked to enter a PayNow nickname as well. You are encouraged to choose a nickname that can help others identify who you are. This is because when a sender wishes to transfer money to you via PayNow, he/she will enter your PayNow Proxy and perform a lookup. The lookup will return your Nickname, and will allow the sender to verify that he/she is indeed transferring money to the right person.To protect your privacy, please do not use a personal identifier which can be found in your NRIC / Passport as your nickname.
Yes, you may change your PayNow Nickname using the Edit option on the digibank App.
All single, joint-alternate and joint-all DBS/POSB Current and Savings accounts are eligible to be linked to PayNow Proxies. However, please note that joint-all accounts can only receive funds and cannot be used to send funds.
Yes, each joint account holder can choose to link his/her own PayNow Proxies to the same joint account.
Once you close your bank account, all PayNow proxies linked to that account will automatically be de-registered, and you will be notified accordingly via SMS.
Yes, you may change the bank account linked to your PayNow proxies using the Edit option on the digibank App.
The maximum limit for PayNow transfers is the same as of your daily local interbank transfer limit. You can manage this limit online via DBS digibank.
The maximum transaction amount for PayNow is S$200k per transaction, which follows the industry limit and cannot be adjusted.
PayNow transfers up to a cumulative daily limit of S$1,000 can be performed without requiring your digibank token.
For PayNow transfers above S$1,000, you will need to perform transaction signing (using your digibank token).
The transfer limit for a PayNow QR is the same as a normal PayNow transfer.
Prior to performing a PayNow transfer, you should check whether the PayNow Proxy you are sending funds to belongs to your intended payee.
During the PayNow transfer process, once you enter the PayNow Proxy that you wish to pay, a lookup will be performed and the PayNow Nickname associated with the Proxy will be displayed. You should check whether the displayed Nickname belongs to the person to whom you are transferring funds.
You should call our DBS/POSB hotline immediately to report the erroneous transfer and to follow our usual procedures for such mistaken transfers. In addition, you should lodge a police report, and be responsive to police investigations.
The bank will try its best to recover the funds on your behalf. However, do note that the bank does not guarantee successful recovery of such funds and you are encouraged to be prudent to check the Nickname and Proxy details before submitting the transfer.
You should call our DBS/POSB hotline immediately to report the erroneous transfer and we will take the necessary steps to reverse such transaction.
Please note that if we are informed by the sender of the funds (or an authorised representative) that a transfer was made to you erroneously, the Bank has the right to and may reverse such transaction pursuant to our Standard Terms and Conditions Governing Accounts without further reference to you. If you wish to dispute the error alleged by the sender, you may approach the sender of the funds directly.
We wish to highlight that it is a criminal offence to hold or use funds that do not belong to you.
PayNow transactions appearing on your bank statement will include the term ""PayNow Transfer"" together with the name of your payee. These transactions will NOT include details of your payee's bank or bank account number. Do note, however, that PayNow transfers between two DBS accounts will be formatted differently in your bank statement, as compared to PayNow transfers between a DBS and a non-DBS account.
PayNow transactions on your payee's bank statement will NOT include your bank details (i.e. bank's name and account number). The specific transaction format will be determined by your payee's bank.
For PayNow transfers made by you, your recipient will be able to see your full name according to your registered record with the bank. We are required to share this information with the receiving bank in line with the prevention of money laundering. The receiving bank may in turn display your full name to enable the recipient to identify the sender.
For PayNow transfers received by you, your sender will only be able to see your PayNow nickname as chosen by you.
You will receive an SMS notification for outgoing PayNow transfers, and an email notification for incoming PayNow transfers, unless you have opted to receive notification via another mode, for example, through a push note.
Paynow QR is an easier way for consumers to pay corporates and other consumers. By using the Scan and Pay function in digibank Mobile / PayLah!, consumers can scan a PayNow QR to initiate a PayNow transfer to the mobile number/UEN of the recipient consumer/corporate respectively.
My QR is the QR Code created for your PayNow Mobile proxy. It is available to you once you register your mobile number with PayNow via DBS/POSB digibank. You can share this QR code to receive funds easily via your PayNow registered mobile number.
Generate QR is a PayNow QR which you can generate for various specified purposes. You can specify the amount, description and the expiry date for each generated QR, before sharing the QR code.

The purpose of this feature is to provide the sender with a degree of assurance that he will be transferring the funds to his intended recipient, and so help to prevent erroneous transfers.
The process is the same as with the current PayNow process. Instead of keying in a PayNow user mobile number (e.g.: +6512345678) or VPA (e.g.: +6512345678#XNAP), you will need to request your India recipient (beneficiary) to provide you their registered UPI ID and key in that UPI ID.

3D Secure (3DS) is an added layer of security feature powered by Mastercard, Visa, AMEX and UnionPay to protect credit and debit cardholders from unauthorised online card transactions. This service is available at 3DS merchant websites/apps where an additional password protection like Digital Token or SMS OTP is required to authenticate the online card transaction.
3D Secure merchants refers to a merchant that has enabled 3DS authentication. Merchant websites/apps that support 3DS technology may incorporate the following logos:
This is dependent on the merchant's websites/apps. If the merchant websites/apps you transact on supports 3D Secure technology, you may be prompted for further verification (such as Digital Token or SMS OTP authentication) before completing the online card transactions.
When a cardholder makes a purchase at a merchant websites/apps that uses 3DS, the cardholder may be asked to authenticate that transaction, by tapping on a push notification sent via their DBS Digital Token or entering a OTP sent via SMS, before the transaction can be completed.
This simple service enables buyers to validate transactions made over the internet by requesting a push notification sent via your DBS Digital Token. It helps protect customers against fraudulent use by unauthorised individuals.
Using the Digital Token
To authenticate your online purchases, either tap on the push notification sent to your mobile phone, or tap on the digibank/iWealth app icon. Once the app is launched, tap the button ""Tap to approve"" to complete your authentication.
Please enable push notification on your mobile phone and ensure stable network connectivity.
If you are still unable to receive the Digital Token push notification, after attempting a 3DS transaction, please go to your digibank app and tap on ""Digital Token"" next to the Login button to authenticate your transaction.

No, you can lock any available funds in your existing Current and/or Savings Accounts instantly on the digibank app. Simply tap the ""lock with digiVault"" icon in the account you'd like to lock savings.
You will continue to enjoy all the benefits of your existing account.
Your locked funds will be protected from scammers gaining digital access while you continue to enjoy your account benefits. Locked funds cannot be accessed digitally. However, certain transactions such as fees for unsuccessful GIRO deductions and SimplyGo payments may still be deducted if needed.
You can lock any amount but do keep enough available balance to avoid late fees and charges as you will not be able to access your locked funds until you release them.
List:
- New or existing payment arrangements (e.g. GIRO, standing instructions or future-dated transfers)
- Transfers to another DBS/POSB account
- Transfers to another bank's account (e.g. local and overseas transfers)
- Bill or credit card payments
- Fixed deposit placements or investments
- Insurance purchases or payments

You can check your digibank app. Go to the account where you have locked savings, tap on it to show details. The locked amount will show as ""Protected by digiVault"".
You can go to your digibank app. Go to the account where you have locked savings and under your account details, look for Available Balance. This is the amount available for you to spend, withdraw or transfer. Available balance does not include any pending debit card transactions and/or promotional Fixed Deposits that you may have signed up for.
If you would like to know how much you have locked, you can refer to the digibank app. Locked amount will show as 'Protected by digiVault' in your account.
digiVault lets you decide how you wish to protect your money. A digiVault Account is a separate locked account that auto-locks all the funds you deposit. While locking savings in an existing account means you can choose any amount inside that account to lock. The first way separates your spending with a dedicated savings account. While the latter allows you to keep spending from your existing account, depending on how much you lock.
Both ways give your savings extra protection, so it's up to you.
Yes, you can first unlock your digiVault Account and transfer funds to any existing accounts and lock it instantly on the digibank app. Simply tap the ""lock with digiVault"" icon in the account you'd like to lock savings.
Yes, you can lock funds in your Joint-Alternate Current and/or Savings Account.
Joint-ALL account funds are not eligible for locking, as they are already protected against digital transactions.
To unlock funds for Joint-Alternate Accounts, any ONE account holder can unlock instantly at any DBS/POSB ATM, Branch Teller Machine (BTM) or Video Teller Machine (VTM).
Yes, you can still lock funds in such an account. But any amount you lock cannot be used until you unlock them. We recommend that you set aside enough funds for your investments, trading or settlements before locking.
You can unlock your funds instantly at any DBS/POSB ATM, BTM or VTM, and transfer funds into another personal account before you close your account. Please refer to our Help & Support page for more information to close a deposit account.
You may lock any amount of funds in your existing Joint-Alternate Current and/or Savings Accounts instantly on the digibank app. Simply tap the ""lock with digiVault"" icon in the account you'd like to lock savings.

Lock your Fixed Deposits
In view of the rise in scam volume over the years, we have reviewed our Fixed Deposits feature to help you safeguard your assets with us. From 02 September 2024, all Fixed Deposit placements done over the counter will automatically be placed under digiVault protection, unless you inform us otherwise at the point of transaction. This is an added layer of security against scammers by preventing unauthorised digital withdrawals from your Fixed Deposit placements during your tenor.
It will follow the maturity instruction that you have set when placing the Fixed Deposit, with one exception*.
Upon maturity, if your maturity instruction is to:
List:
- Rollover Principal and Interest: Principal amount and Interest will rollover and stay locked.
- Rollover Principal and Withdraw Interest: Principal amount will rollover and stay locked, while the interest will be credited to your designated account on the date of maturity.
- Withdraw Principal and interest to your designated account: Principal amount and Interest will be credited to your designated account within 2 working days.
Rollover Principal and Interest: Principal amount and Interest will rollover and stay locked.
Rollover Principal and Withdraw Interest: Principal amount will rollover and stay locked, while the interest will be credited to your designated account on the date of maturity.
Withdraw Principal and interest to your designated account: Principal amount and Interest will be credited to your designated account within 2 working days.
*If you have a locked placement maturing before 16 September 2024, and its maturity instruction is to Withdraw Principal and Interest, upon maturity, the Principal amount will rollover and stay locked, while the interest will be credited to your designated account.
Digital premature withdrawal and changing of maturity instructions will be blocked. This prevents scammers from targeting your placements.
You can check your digibank app. Go to the account where you have locked Fixed Deposit placements, tap on it to show details. The locked placement will show as ""Protected by digiVault"".
You may also refer to your Monthly Consolidated Statement. A locked placement will have a description that says ""PROTECTED BY DIGIVAULT"".
For Joint-Alternate Fixed Deposit accounts: You may lock it on the digibank app, just like any other Fixed Deposit placement.
For Joint-ALL Fixed Deposit accounts: They are not eligible for locking as they are already protected against digital premature withdrawals. There is already an added layer of protection since the approval of ALL account holders are needed to make any changes.
Yes, you need to have an existing Fixed Deposit placement to lock before you proceed to lock it on the digibank app. Simply tap the ""lock with digiVault"" icon in the account you'd like to lock your Fixed Deposits.
No, you can apply to lock your Fixed Deposits without opening a digiVault Account.

Alternatively, you can lock any amount of funds in your existing Current and/or Savings Accounts in the digibank app if you wish to continue enjoying all the benefits of your existing account. Simply tap the ""lock with digiVault"" icon in the account you'd like to lock your savings.
Yes, you can have more than 1 digiVault. As digiVault Account is a My Account with the added security of a physical vault, we allow our customers to have up to 5 My Accounts, including those used as a digiVault Account.
You will need to close one of your existing My Account if you already have 5 My Accounts. You can do so via digibank online or visit the nearest branch if you are unable to do so.

Scamshield Feature - For Singaporean customers
ScamShield is an initiative by the Singapore Police Force and the National Crime Prevention Council. Singaporean customers may find more information on ScamShield at https://www.scamshield.org.sg/.
Block scam calls - ScamShield compares an incoming call against a list maintained by the Singapore Police Force to determine if the number has been used for illegal purposes and blocks it.
Filter scam SMSes - When you receive an SMS from an unknown contact, ScamShield will determine if the SMS is a scam using an on-device algorithm, and filter the messages to a junk SMS folder. Scam SMSes will be sent to NCPC and SPF for collation to keep app updated and help protect others from such scam calls and messages.
Report scam messages - You can also report scam messages from other chat apps such as WhatsApp, Wechat, IMO, Viber, etc. You can forward the messages via ScamShield's in-app reporting function.
Voice Phishing Alert
Date: 12 April 2024
Description: Beware of scammers impersonating DBS Bank staff and government officials through voice phishing calls. These calls may claim there are unauthorised fund transfers or credit card payments on your account and seek your assistance in the investigation.
These scammers ask for sensitive information such as your personal details, DBS digibank credentials, OTPs, or ask you to transfer funds to their bank accounts.
To increase the believability of this scam, the scammers provide a case number or identification, such as photo of a staff pass. Victims of this scam are told not to divulge details of the investigation to anyone, including official bank staff.
Always verify directly with DBS Bank should you receive such calls. DBS and other governmental agencies will never ask you for your credit or debit card details, CVV, SMS or email OTPs, or Digital Token approvals.
Report scams to protect your family, friends, and our community.
List:
- Help protect your friends and family by reporting scams and suspicious deals to the appropriate authorities, such as consumer protection agencies or local police.
- Use ScamShield, an app that helps you block scam calls and SMSes and use it to report scam calls, SMSes and messages from chat apps li",

We will provide you with transaction notifications and a reporting channel so that you may be alerted of unauthorised transactions and report them when they happen.
We will investigate claims of unauthorised transactions with the aim of achieving a fair and reasonable resolution. The Guidelines do not apply to transactions which you initiated because of a scam or fraud. Such transactions will be investigated by the police.
How can I report an unauthorized transaction?
Please call our 24-hour DBS Customer Service Hotline at 1800 339 6963 or +65 6339 6963 (Overseas) immediately for assistance. Our customer service officer will ask you to provide more details about yourself, your protected account and the transaction in order for us to commence investigations and update you.
How can I report an erroneous transaction?
Please call our 24-hour DBS Customer Service Hotline at 1800 111 1111 or +65 6327 2265 (Overseas) immediately for assistance. Our customer service officer will ask you to provide more details about yourself, your protected account and the transaction in order for us to commence investigations and update you.
What happens after I report an unauthorised transaction?
After receiving the information required to facilitate the investigation, we will complete an investigation of any relevant claim within 21 business days for straightforward cases or 45 business days for complex cases.
Complex cases may include cases where any party to the unauthorised transaction is residing overseas or where the Bank has insufficient information from you to complete the investigation. We will update you of the outcome of our investigation. If it has been assessed that you are not liable for any loss from the unauthorised transaction, we will credit your account as soon as our assessment is complete.
For erroneous or unauthorised transactions on credit cards, charge cards or debit cards, the dispute resolution process established under the respective card scheme will apply.
What happens after I report an erroneous transaction?
We will endeavour to assist to recall the funds from the recipient and update you of the outcome. Longer time may be taken for more complex cases.
What are my liabilities for losses arising from unauthorised transactions?
You will not be liable for any loss that arises from any action or omission by us, if you have complied with your duties as an account holder. For losses due to any other independent third party other than you and us, subject to the below, you will also not be liable if the outgoing transaction value is within S$1,000.
You will, however, be liable if it is ascertained that the primary cause was recklessness on your part, such as failing to protect your access code, login credentials or access to your protected account. Your liability will be capped at the transaction limit or daily payment limit, where applicable.
In all cases, we will conduct an assessment to determine the appropriate liabilities and work towards a fair and reasonable resolution.
For transactions on credit cards, charge cards and debit cards issued in Singapore, the apportioning of liabilities is governed by the ABS Code of Consumer Banking Practice.
What is a protected account?
Protected accounts are those that:
What type of transactions are covered by the Guidelines?
The Guidelines cover all payments from protected accounts initiated through electronic means, and where funds are received through electronic means.
The Guidelines do not apply to transactions which you initiated because of a scam or fraud.
What are my duties as an account holder or account user?
The Guidelines set out your duties as an e-payment user to adopt good security practices. These include:
What are transaction notifications for?
They safeguard you against unauthorised and erroneous transactions. They are to alert you of such transactions so that you may report them to us for quicker resolution.
What are the types of transaction notifications offered by DBS and how can I enrol for these notifications?
Please refer to our Transaction Alerts page.
The Monetary Authority of Singapore has issued the E-Payments User Protection Guidelines (""Guidelines"") to protect users of electronic payments and encourage wider adoption of e-payments in Singapore. The Guidelines establishes a common baseline protection that financial institutions will provide to individuals or sole proprietors from losses arising from isolated unauthorised or erroneous epayment transactions from their protected accounts. Here are some common questions about the Guidelines.

Other PayNow-related Topics
PayNow is an electronic fund transfer service that allows you to transfer SGD funds5 instantly to a payee, using the payee's designated mobile number or NRIC/FIN or UEN number instead of his/her bank account number.
A payee can receive funds via PayNow as long as he/she has a Singapore bank account with one of the PayNow participating banks6, and has registered his mobile number, UEN or NRIC/FIN as a PayNow Proxy with the participating bank.
5You can transfer SGD funds via PayNow up to your maximum daily local interbank transfer limit. You can check and amend this limit via digibank. Daily transfer limit is capped at SGD200k.6PayNow is only available for participating banks in Singapore. See question 4 for the list of participating banks.
You can register for PayNow via digibank. During registration, you will be asked to (1) select the DBS/POSB account that you want to link to your selected PayNow Proxy (mobile number and/or NRIC/FIN number), and (2) set a PayNow Nickname for your registration.
Please note that you will need to register for PayNow first, before you can receive funds into your DBS/POSB bank account via PayNow.
When a sender wishes to transfer funds to you via PayNow, he/she will enter your PayNow Proxy and perform a lookup. Doing so will display your PayNow Nickname, which in turn will allow the sender to verify that he/she is indeed transferring funds to the right person.
Please note that the Bank may limit the number of times a user can perform a Lookup within a time period. In addition, the Bank may, at its discretion, suspend or withdraw the PayNow service from any user found abusing the lookup feature.

A PayNow Proxy is a personal identifier that you can link to your bank account.
Existing customers with DBS or POSB current/savings accounts can link the following proxies to their bank account:a. NRIC or FIN number;b. A mobile number (local or foreign) that you have registered with DBS/POSB.
Please note that you can only register your bank-registered NRIC/FIN number and mobile number as PayNow Proxies, so please be sure to update your details with us.
Existing customers can make a transfer to the following proxies belonging to their friend or merchant
Similar to mobile, NRIC/FIN and UEN, a VPA is a proxy that is used as an identifier, that can be uniquely mapped to an individual account. However, VPA is a proxy used only by Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NFIs), where users of participating NFIs can link to their e-wallets to receive funds via PayNow.
A VPA will always have the following format:

Note that you will only be able to link your mobile number and NRIC/FIN number to your DBS or POSB current/savings account.
Yes, you may link both Proxies (NRIC/FIN and mobile number) to the same bank account.
No. If you have already linked your Proxy to a DBS/POSB bank account and wish to register the same Proxy with another bank, you will need to first de-register the Proxy from your DBS/POSB account (using the ""Delete"" option) via digibank before you can register it with another bank.
Yes, you can link one Proxy (such as your mobile number) to one bank account and a different Proxy (such as your NRIC/FIN) to another bank account. The two accounts can be from 2 different participating banks.
If you have already updated your FIN number with DBS/POSB, you can register your FIN as a PayNow Proxy via DBS digibank or digibank App.
If you are unable to see an option to register your FIN for PayNow, it might be because you have not updated your FIN with DBS. Learn to update your FIN on digibank mobile or SingPass here.
Once you receive your blue NRIC, please proceed to the nearest DBS/POSB branch to update your NRIC in the bank's records. During the update process, your FIN Proxy will be de-registered from PayNow and your NRIC will become eligible for registration.
You can subsequently register your NRIC as a PayNow Proxy, via DBS digibank or your digibank App.
If you have recently changed your mobile number, you should first update your new mobile number with the bank. You can do so via DBS digibank, or by visiting a DBS/POSB branch.
Once you have updated your mobile number with the bank, your old mobile number will automatically be de-registered from PayNow. An SMS notification will be sent to the old mobile number, to confirm the de-registration.
You can then register your new mobile number as a PayNow Proxy via digibank.
This might be because you have already registered that mobile number as a PayNow Proxy with another bank, in which case you will first need to de-register your Proxy from the other bank. Please note that you cannot register the same mobile number as a PayNow Proxy with 2 different banks.
However, if you have never registered your mobile number as a PayNow Proxy with another bank, such a scenario might arise if you are using a recycled mobile number that used to belong to someone else. You can call our hotline or visit your nearest DBS/POSB branch to report this issue, and our bank officers will assist you accordingly. Please note that such issues may take up to 9 working days to be resolved.
Please note that only bank-registered mobile numbers can be registered as PayNow Proxies i.e. you will not be able to type in any mobile number you want to register. Your PayNow Proxy mobile number will be extracted from the bank's internal database, based on the mobile registered with the bank. It is therefore important that you provide us with your updated contact particulars, including your email address, so that we can reach you to resolve any matters related to PayNow.
As an additional control, when a mobile number is being registered as a PayNow Proxy, an SMS-OTP will be sent to that mobile number to verify that the registrant is indeed the rightful owner of the mobile number.
Yes, you may log in to your digibank mobile or digibank online to check. Find out more on how to check on your PayNow profile here.
When you link a PayNow Proxy to your bank account, you will be asked to enter a PayNow nickname as well. You are encouraged to choose a nickname that can help others identify who you are. This is because when a sender wishes to transfer money to you via PayNow, he/she will enter your PayNow Proxy and perform a lookup. The lookup will return your Nickname, and will allow the sender to verify that he/she is indeed transferring money to the right person.To protect your privacy, please do not use a personal identifier which can be found in your NRIC / Passport as your nickname.
Yes, you may change your PayNow Nickname using the Edit option on the digibank App.
All single, joint-alternate and joint-all DBS/POSB Current and Savings accounts are eligible to be linked to PayNow Proxies. However, please note that joint-all accounts can only receive funds and cannot be used to send funds.
Yes, each joint account holder can choose to link his/her own PayNow Proxies to the same joint account.
Once you close your bank account, all PayNow proxies linked to that account will automatically be de-registered, and you will be notified accordingly via SMS.
Yes, you may change the bank account linked to your PayNow proxies using the Edit option on the digibank App.
The maximum limit for PayNow transfers is the same as of your daily local interbank transfer limit. You can manage this limit online via DBS digibank.
The maximum transaction amount for PayNow is S$200k per transaction, which follows the industry limit and cannot be adjusted.
PayNow transfers up to a cumulative daily limit of S$1,000 can be performed without requiring your digibank token.
For PayNow transfers above S$1,000, you will need to perform transaction signing (using your digibank token).
The transfer limit for a PayNow QR is the same as a normal PayNow transfer.
Prior to performing a PayNow transfer, you should check whether the PayNow Proxy you are sending funds to belongs to your intended payee.
During the PayNow transfer process, once you enter the PayNow Proxy that you wish to pay, a lookup will be performed and the PayNow Nickname associated with the Proxy will be displayed. You should check whether the displayed Nickname belongs to the person to whom you are transferring funds.
You should call our DBS/POSB hotline immediately to report the erroneous transfer and to follow our usual procedures for such mistaken transfers. In addition, you should lodge a police report, and be responsive to police investigations.
The bank will try its best to recover the funds on your behalf. However, do note that the bank does not guarantee successful recovery of such funds and you are encouraged to be prudent to check the Nickname and Proxy details before submitting the transfer.
You should call our DBS/POSB hotline immediately to report the erroneous transfer and we will take the necessary steps to reverse such transaction.
Please note that if we are informed by the sender of the funds (or an authorised representative) that a transfer was made to you erroneously, the Bank has the right to and may reverse such transaction pursuant to our Standard Terms and Conditions Governing Accounts without further reference to you. If you wish to dispute the error alleged by the sender, you may approach the sender of the funds directly.
We wish to highlight that it is a criminal offence to hold or use funds that do not belong to you.
PayNow transactions appearing on your bank statement will include the term ""PayNow Transfer"" together with the name of your payee. These transactions will NOT include details of your payee's bank or bank account number. Do note, however, that PayNow transfers between two DBS accounts will be formatted differently in your bank statement, as compared to PayNow transfers between a DBS and a non-DBS account.
PayNow transactions on your payee's bank statement will NOT include your bank details (i.e. bank's name and account number). The specific transaction format will be determined by your payee's bank.
For PayNow transfers made by you, your recipient will be able to see your full name according to your registered record with the bank. We are required to share this information with the receiving bank in line with the prevention of money laundering. The receiving bank may in turn display your full name to enable the recipient to identify the sender.
For PayNow transfers received by you, your sender will only be able to see your PayNow nickname as chosen by you.
You will receive an SMS notification for outgoing PayNow transfers, and an email notification for incoming PayNow transfers, unless you have opted to receive notification via another mode, for example, through a push note.
Paynow QR is an easier way for consumers to pay corporates and other consumers. By using the Scan and Pay function in digibank Mobile / PayLah!, consumers can scan a PayNow QR to initiate a PayNow transfer to the mobile number/UEN of the recipient consumer/corporate respectively.
My QR is the QR Code created for your PayNow Mobile proxy. It is available to you once you register your mobile number with PayNow via DBS/POSB digibank. You can share this QR code to receive funds easily via your PayNow registered mobile number.
Generate QR is a PayNow QR which you can generate for various specified purposes. You can specify the amount, description and the expiry date for each generated QR, before sharing the QR code.
My QR is automatically generated once you register your mobile number with DBS/POSB via PayNow. Select Scan and Pay from the login screen of your DBS/POSB digibank App, and select My QR to access your My QR
To Generate a PayNow QR and edit the amount, description and expiry date, Select Scan and Pay from the login screen of your DBS/POSB digibank App, and select Generate QR. Fill in the details to create your specified PayNow QR.
You can select Scan and Pay from the home screen of your DBS/POSB digibank App.

Total Account Balance
Total Balance refers to the total amount of all placements in an SGD Fixed Deposit (FD) account. The amount includes all new and existing placements/renewals.
With the new S$30,000 placement, the total FD account balance will be S$50,000 (S$20,000 + S$30,000). Hence, interest rate corresponding to the $50,000 - $99,999 range will apply. Learn More
The total FD account balance is S$100,000 (S$30,000 + S$70,000). Hence, interest rate corresponding to the $100,000 - $249,999 range will apply.
The placements are in different SGD FD accounts. Hence, interest rate corresponding to the $50,000 - $99,999 range will apply for each renewal.

For personal account, only the administrator or executor of your estate can make a claim on your account. Upon receiving notification of your death, the existing maturity instructions (e.g. credit to Savings account) given previously will no longer be valid. Upon maturity, the Fixed Deposit (principal and interest) will be automatically renewed for the same tenor at the prevailing interest rate. If your Fixed Deposit Account is a joint account, the surviving account holder can claim the money in the account.
We are working on creating that seamless one-glance option for you and will keep you updated.
In view of the rise in scam volume over the years, we have reviewed our Fixed Deposits feature to help you safeguard your assets with us. From 02 September 2024, all Fixed Deposit placements done over the counter will automatically be placed under digiVault protection, unless you inform us otherwise at the point of transaction. This is as an added layer of security against scammers by preventing unauthorised digital withdrawals from your Fixed Deposit placements during your tenor.

Note:POSB Smart Buddy is powered by NETS contactless (embedded in your child's watch), which means that your child's watch can also be accepted on public transport. Your child may use the watch for transit when he/she forgets to bring their School Smartcard. However, if Smart Buddy watch is used for transit, full adult fare will be charged (concession rates will not apply).
Please note you are unable to temporary lock or disable contactless payments via Payment Controls, or block cards for the first bus and train fare transactions. Avoid tapping your card/device on the fare readers if you do not intend to pay via this method.

Frequently Asked Questions
Fave is a fintech platform providing QR payments & Loyalty Cashback to restaurant & retailers. Starting from August 2020, DBS PayLah! users can transact digitally via the scanning of SGQR codes at FavePay partners.
Fave has 3 types of cashback:
Fave Cashback: Fave Cashback is earned via a promo code and usable across all product functions - FavePay, Fave Deals and eCards. Valid for 30 days.
Fave e-Cashback: These are valid for 3 months from the date of issuance to offset your future transactions on Fave app, such as Fave deals, or eCards.
Fave Partner Cashback: This cashback is earned via a FavePay transaction and usable at the same merchant. It is the return of a percentage of your total bill (not including any amount paid with promo codes and cashback) in the form of partner cashback. For example, the restaurant offers a 15% cashback. Your total bill at XYZ Restaurant is S$10 and you pay S$2 in cashback, while S$8 is paid for in cash.
After a successful FavePay transaction, you will receive S$1.20 (15% of cash amount paid) in partner cashback that can be used during your next visit at XYZ Restaurant. This cashback will be added to your partner cashback. You can use the cashback for your next FavePay transaction with the same partner as they are valid for 2-3 months. The validity of the cashback is indicated in your Fave account.
Fave Deals and eCards are pre-purchased vouchers that can be used at Fave's participating partners. These vouchers can be bought via the Fave app with Fave credits.

This PAssion POSB Debit Card can be used at ATMs and for PIN-based transactions at selected merchants in Singapore and at Maestro or Cirrus enabled merchants overseas. It also allows you to sign for local and overseas purchases and perform contactless payment via Mastercard® contactless, card-not-present transactions (such as online, mail and phone orders), which shall be paid for by directly deducting the transaction amount(s) from your bank account.
Your Mastercard Debit Limit for signature-based, Mastercard contactless and card-not-present transactions is set at S$2,000. A Debit Card carries risks of unauthorised signature-based, Mastercard contactless or card-not-present transactions. You may choose to increase/decrease this limit upon activation.

The unused balance in your child's CDA will be transferred to his or her Post-Secondary Education Account (PSEA) up to a cap, any excess balance above the cap will be transferred to the CSA. These funds can then be used to pay for post-secondary education fees in Singapore for your child and his or her siblings.
You can use funds from the POSB Smiley CDA to pay for childcare or medical expenses via NETS or interbank GIRO. Check out the list of Approved Institutions (AIs).
The CSA is designed to provide every child with a personal bank account, to conveniently receive Government cash payments such as Baby Bonus Cash Gift, excess CDA balance, and education awards through electronic payments.
It is a joint savings account that opens automatically at the same time with the CDA when a child is enrolled for the Baby Bonus Scheme. It operates like a regular joint savings account (jointly held under the child and trustee) with no minimum balance requirement, fees or charges imposed on the CSA.
If you have digibank online/mobile and an email address with us, your account will be automatically enrolled with eStatement.
Baby Bonus Cash Gift (if eligible) is paid into your child's Child Savings Account (CSA) every 6 months till your child is 6.5 years old.
To avoid delays in receiving Government cash payments such as the Baby Bonus Cash Gift and education awards, please keep your child's CSA open.

Ways to apply
or visit us at a branch.
Faqs
Cashback is not awarded on the following: Annual card fees, Cash-On-Instalments, Instalment Payment Plan, PayLite, tax payments, interest, late payment charges, cash advances, balance transfers, bill payments made via Internet Banking, AXS or SAM network, and other fees and charges.
Faqs
Transactions which are performed at merchants that fall into the exclusion categories/excluded organisations as set out in theTerms and Conditions governing OCBC 365 Credit Card Cashback Programmeare excluded from the calculation of the minimum spend.
Faqs
The maximum amount of cashback that one account (the principal and all supplementary cardholders together) can earn each month is S$160. This works out to a total of up to S$1,920 in cashback every year.
Faqs
The cashback earned on the transactions performed in the current month will be credited in the OCBC 365 card statement in the next month.
Faqs
Transaction date refers to the date when a purchase is made.
Faqs
Posting date refers to the date the transaction is received by the card issuer, OCBC Bank. As merchants may make a settlement a few days after the transaction has been made, posting date may be a few days later than the transaction date. As such, the bank has no control over when merchant records the transaction.
Faqs
The cashback computation is based on the transactions posted within the calendar month.
Faqs
The MCC is a four digit-number assigned by Visa/Mastercard to describe the main business activity of a merchant. It is determined by the merchant's acquiring bank (a financial institution that accepts and processes credit and debit card transactions on behalf of merchants).
Faqs
As the card issuer, OCBC does not determine the main business activity of a merchant or the MCC assigned.
Faqs
We use MCCs to decide whether certain transactions qualify for cashback. For example, OCBC 365 Cardmembers earn cashback only on transactions that fall under certain MCCs (e.g. MCC 5812 - Eating places and Restaurant).
Faqs
If the merchant's acquiring bank assigns it an incorrect MCC, we will not be able to reward you for transactions made there. For example, if a merchant was determined to be a 'Bar' instead of a 'Restaurant', an OCBC 365 Cardmember will not be able to earn cashback on transactions made there - since transactions under 'MCC 5813 - Bars, Taverns, Lounges, Disco' do not qualify for cashback.",credit cards

Faqs
Enjoy 10 times the base OCBC$ (equivalent to 4 air miles) for every S$1 spent on transactions that fall under the following Merchant Category Codes:
Faqs
Alternatively, transactions must be made at any of the following merchants^^(or merchants which may be stated on the OCBC Rewards Card webpage from time to time):
Faqs
^Transactions made using Shopee Pay under MCC 5262 will not earn any OCBC$.^^Transactions under MCC 5411 (Grocery stores and Supermarkets) will not earn any bonus OCBC$."" MCCs are assigned by payment card organisations (e.g. Visa, MasterCard, American Express), which OCBC has no discretion over. A merchant's registered MCC may not always correspond with its nature of business.
Faqs
There is no limit to the base OCBC$ you can earn. You can earn up to 120,000 bonus OCBC$ a year, and up to 10,000 bonus OCBC$ a month.
Faqs
Bonus OCBC$ can be earned through transactions made by the principal and supplementary card holder(s). Then, the OCBC$ will be credited to the primary card holder's OCBC$ account.
Faqs
Once the limit of 10,000 bonus OCBC$ is reached for the month, you will earn the base OCBC$ (i.e. 1 OCBC$ for every S$1 spent) for your transactions.
Faqs
The base OCBC$ of 1 OCBC$ for every S$1 spent will be credited to your account when the transaction is posted.
Faqs
If the transaction qualifies for bonus OCBC$, the remaining 9 OCBC$ for every S$1 spent will be credited by the last day of the next month.
Faqs
For example, if a S$500 Lazada purchase is made on:
Faqs
15 November 2023 (transaction date) and posted on 17 November 2023 (posted date), 500 OCBC$ will be credited to your account on 15 November 2023 and the remaining 4,500 OCBC$ on 31 December 2023.
Faqs
28 November 2023 (transaction date) and posted on 2 December 2023 (posted date), 500 OCBC$ will be credited to your account on 28 November 2023 and the remaining 4,500 OCBC$ on 31 January 2024.
Faqs
The MCC is a four digit-number assigned by Visa/Mastercard to describe the main business activity of a merchant. It is determined by the merchant's acquiring bank (a financial institution that accepts and processes credit and debit card transactions on behalf of merchants).
Faqs
As the card issuer, OCBC does not determine the main business activity of a merchant or the MCC assigned.
Faqs
We use MCCs to decide whether certain transactions qualify for OCBC$. For example, OCBC Rewards Cardmembers earn bonus OCBC$ only on transactions that fall under certain MCCs (e.g. MCC 5261 - Women's Ready to Wear Stores).
Faqs
If the merchant's acquiring bank assigns it an incorrect MCC, we will not be able to reward you for transactions made there. For example, if a merchant was determined to be a 'Tailor' instead of a 'Women's Ready to Wear Store', an OCBC Rewards Cardmember will not be able to earn bonus OCBC$ on transactions made there - since transactions under 'MCC 5697 - Alterations, Mending, Seamstresses, Tailors' do not qualify for bonus OCBC$.",credit cards

Car loan eligibility and quantum depends on several factors, including but not limited to your outstanding loan liabilities and monthly income. Depending on the open market value (OMV) of the vehicle, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) limits financing up to 60%/70% of the purchase price.

A COE - or Certificate of Entitlement - gives you the right to own and use a vehicle in Singapore. The cost of getting a COE is also factored into a car loan. You can check the latest COE prices and bidding results in Singapore on theOneMotoring page. You can also use a loan calculator to find out the monthly instalments for your car purchases.
Faq
Loans usually come with an interest rate that is payable on top of the principal amount. To calculate the total loan amount you will need to repay, add the principal sum together with the interest. You can use an interest calculator, or use the following formula:
Faq
Interest payable = Loan amount * interest rate * (number of payments/12)
Faq
Upon successful application, you will also receive a breakdown of the total loan amount, including the interest.",loans

We offer both fixed and variable packages for HDB and private property. Please refer to our HDB & Private Home Loan packages above for more details.
Faq
There are several key differences between a HDB Housing Loan and a Bank Loan. Customers will have to weigh between the different loan-to-value limits including initial cash outlay requirements, loan tenure, interest rates packages and their respective prepayment fees before deciding which best suit their needs.
Faq
Home loan rules and pricing can be complex, hence customers should speak to a mortgage specialist to gain a deeper understanding of the financial considerations involved.
Faq
Those looking to purchase a new private property can loan up to 75% of their property's valuation or purchase price, whichever is lower. This applies to customers with no outstanding home loans. For example, if the property is valued and purchased at S$1,000,000, the maximum loan amount is S$750,000. Other factors such as the loan tenure, Loan-To-Value (LTV) or Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) will also affect the final loan amount.
Faq
If you already have an existing home loan with another bank, you can also considerrefinancing your home loanwith us and enjoy interest savings.
Faq
Having a bad credit score can affect your loan eligibility. AtOCBC Bank, our mortgage specialist will take into account your credit history as well as other factors such as your age, income and liabilities to assess your repayment ability.
