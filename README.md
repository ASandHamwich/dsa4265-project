Over half of Singaporeans don't even know how much they spend each month. Despite the abundance of budgeting apps, most people simply don't have the time or motivation to manually track their expenses. Even when individuals do track their expenses, the large amount of raw data can be difficult to make sense of. As such, FinTailorAI aims bridges this knowledge gap by **automatically analyzing bank statements**, **categorizing spending**, and **giving personalized advice** that best align with your unique financial profile - with minimum effort from your end.
