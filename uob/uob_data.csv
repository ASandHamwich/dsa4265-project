Before you decide to upgrade to a larger or private property, you should speak to your bank to confirm how much you can borrow to upgrade to a new property.For example, the maximum loan quantum that you can borrow from a bank is determined by the Loan-to-Value ratio or LTV. The LTV considers three factors – the loan tenor, your age and the number of outstanding loans you have. However, there is an exception if you are upgrading from your HDB flat. In such cases, the outstanding loan on your HDB flat will not affect the maximum loan amount for the new property as long as you can provide the necessary documentation to show that your flat has been sold. These include a copy of the approval letter by HDB and a copy of the Borrower’s letter of undertaking to complete the sale of the existing HDB flat.With these documents, your bank can provide you with an In-Principle Approval so that you can have certainty on your eligible loan amount and monthly mortgage repayment amount. This will help guide you to determine the down payment amount needed to purchase a new property and if you can commit to the monthly mortgage repayments.With UOB Instant loan approval, you can get an in principle approval online, in the comfort of your within minutes.","loans"

Once you have activated Money Lock, the locked amount you have set for your account(s) cannot be accessed for payment transactions. For example: Your account balance is S$10,000 and you have set up a Money Lock amount of S$9,000. This means your remaining withdrawable balance is S$1,000. If you try to process a transaction higher than S$1,000 (e.g. purchase with a debit card, PayNow, funds transfer, GIRO or ATM withdrawal etc), the transaction will be unsuccessful. You will need to adjust your locked amount or top up your balances to proceed with the transaction. While your account(s) can continue to receive incoming monies, you will only be able to release the locked funds at a UOB ATM in Singapore. This way, scammers who may have illegally obtained access to your phone or banking app will not be able to transfer your locked funds out of the bank.You can lock any amount of funds with Money Lock. This includes locking only a fraction of your account balances, or the entire balance. If you are expecting a large sum of incoming funds, such as a salary bonus or maturing Fixed Deposit, you can also lock an amount higher than your current account balance.","savings"
